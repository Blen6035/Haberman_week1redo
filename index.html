      <p class="lead">I'm Amanda and I make pretty things. Whether it's graphic design, websites, or arts and crafts, I just like to create. I'm currently pursuing a degree in web design and development in the hopes of being a greater asset to my current employer and maybe someday freelancing on the side. I don't have any children but I do have one dog named Ranger that my husband and I spoil rotten. He can be very dramatic and picky. He is the only dog I know that doesn't like people food and will turn his nose up at a treat.</p>

    <h1 class="display-4">let's put the <b>fun</b> in fun facts</h1>
    <p class="lead">Fun facts are never "fun" but let's see what you think of these. I have a black belt in karate, but it's been 9 years since I trained. I have read the Harry Potter series over 20 times. I don't like peanut butter, I know I'm weird!</p>
